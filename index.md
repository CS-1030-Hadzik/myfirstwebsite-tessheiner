<h1>Tess Heiner</h1>
<p>My name is Tess Heiner. I am currently a student at NUAMES High School, which allows me to do early college at Weber State University. I will be graduating high school with my Associate's Degree.</p>
<p>After graduating high school, I plan to attend University of Utah with a major in biomedical engineering and a minor in Korean studies. I will be moving to Salt Lake City, and studying a semester at the University of Utah Asia campus somewhere in my 5-year plan. </p>
